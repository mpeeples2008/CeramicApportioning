## Introduction

This document provides a brief example of the ceramic apportioning function which replicates methods previously published by Roberts et al. 2012. This script is designed to divide ceramic assemblages into a user specified number of periods based on the overlap in the occupation dates of a site, the production dates of each ceramic type, and some assumptions about the shape of the popularity curve of a ceramic type through time. Specifically, following Roberts et al. 2012, ceramic popularity curves are modeled as a normal distribution centered on the midpoint date and truncated at 2 standard deviations above and below the mean. 

The code is designed to be run most efficiently on a data frame of a format similar to the example used here. Specifically, the data frame should have a row for every site/type/count (this means that site name and site beginning and ending dates may be repeated many times). The data frame at a minimum must include site name, type name, count, site occupation start date, site occupation end date, type production start date, and type production end date. The example data here can serve as a template. Note that this script can be run for multiple sites combined into a single dataframe.

```{r data}
ceramics <- read.csv('preapportion.csv') # read in formatted data
DT::datatable(ceramics)
```

## The Apportioning Function

The following chunk of code includes the apportioning script in it's entirety with embedded comments describing each procedure. The user required input includes Site, Type, Count, a beginning date for the period to be considered, an end date for the period to be considered, the interval size for each period, as well as site beginning and ending dates, and type beginning and ending dates. For more details on the calculations included below, see the Roberts et al. 2012 original publication which describes the method in detail. 

This GitHub page includes a version of the script called "Apportion.R" that can be run directly from source. The code below is identical to that source file.

```{r apportion_script}

require(msm)

apportion <-
  function(Site,      # vector of site names with one entry for every site/type/count
           Type,      # vector of type names with one entry for every site/type/count
           ct,        # vector of counts with one entry for every site/type/count
           beg.date,  # beginning date of the interval to be considered
           end.date,  # end date of the interval to be considered
           interval,  # interval to define period length for apportioning
           site.beg,  # vector of site beginning dates with one entry for every site/type/count

        for (i in 1:nperiods) {
          # if statement determines if a particular interval should be considered
          if (length(intersect(seq(c.lab[i], (c.lab[i] + interval - 1)), ws_overlap[1:length(ws_overlap) - 1])) > 0) {
            zj0 <- (c.lab[i] - m) / (g / (2 * zsd))

## Running the Function

The following chunk of code applies to the apportioning function to the data frame imported above with the period beginning date set to 1200, the end date set to 1450, and with a period interval at 25 years. The results are displayed as an interactive datatable. 

```{r}
results <- apportion(Site = ceramics$Site, Type = ceramics$Type, ct = ceramics$Count, beg.date=1200, end.date=1450, interval=25, site.beg=ceramics$SiteBeg, site.end = ceramics$SiteEnd, type.beg = ceramics$TypeBeg, type.end = ceramics$TypeEnd)

DT::datatable(results)
```

Note that if we use the same data but alter those three values (beg.date, end.date, and interval) we will get different results. For example, if we were to only consider the date range from 1200-1350, the sherds apportioned to later intervals in the first example would go in the "unapportioned" category.

```{r}
results2 <- apportion(Site = ceramics$Site, Type = ceramics$Type, ct = ceramics$Count, beg.date=1200, end.date=1350, interval=25, site.beg=ceramics$SiteBeg, site.end = ceramics$SiteEnd, type.beg = ceramics$TypeBeg, type.end = ceramics$TypeEnd)

DT::datatable(results2)
```

Similarly, we can change the interval size and the apportioned ceramics will change accordingly.

```{r}
results3 <- apportion(Site = ceramics$Site, Type = ceramics$Type, ct = ceramics$Count, beg.date=1200, end.date=1450, interval=50, site.beg=ceramics$SiteBeg, site.end = ceramics$SiteEnd, type.beg = ceramics$TypeBeg, type.end = ceramics$TypeEnd)

DT::datatable(results3)
```

If for some reason you want intervals of say, 42 years, you can do that too.

```{r}
results4 <- apportion(Site = ceramics$Site, Type = ceramics$Type, ct = ceramics$Count, beg.date=1200, end.date=1450, interval=42, site.beg=ceramics$SiteBeg, site.end = ceramics$SiteEnd, type.beg = ceramics$TypeBeg, type.end = ceramics$TypeEnd)

DT::datatable(results4)
```
